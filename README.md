After graduating from the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp, I eventually decided to serve as a teaching assistant. There were so many things I wish someone had told me when I was first learning to code and trying to break into tech. 

Each teaching assistant is generally assigned a small subset of students from a cohort. This lets students work in smaller groups and we get to know one another much better. 

Students are still often nervous though, especially towards the beginning of the bootcamp. I made this quick randomizer to make picking a random student volunteer quicker. It also utilizes the plotly library to display a bar chart showing the distribution of selections so that we can easily see if someone is particularly unlucky.
